#ETL Project

Summary of the ETL Project : 
Extraction from multiple data sets which has a csv file types, then use pandas for the Transformation process. Data Cleanup & Analysis  was also done through pandas. 
Merged all the three data sets via pandas as well. Finally loaded the transformed data frame in to postgre sql table, after creating it using postgre sql. 



Detailed Explaination: 

1. Extraction - Finding Data

I used 2 data sourses and 3 datasets to do my etl project.  

-->Two data sources are Kaggle and Data World. 

Kaggle -: https://www.kaggle.com

Data World -: https://data.world


-->Three data sete are Kaggle and Data World. 

Kaggle -:

Data World -:

        https://data.world/tylerudite/2015-median-income-by-county


    All of the data was based on county through all States. The most recent data set I could find was 2015. And 2017 didn't had all the relevant information I needed to merge the tables. 


2. Transformation - Data Cleanup & Analysis
